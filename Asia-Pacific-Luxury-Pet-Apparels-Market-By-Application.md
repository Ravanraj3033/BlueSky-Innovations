Pet owners are increasingly seeking high-quality, fashionable pet apparel to provide comfort, warmth, and protection for their pets within their homes. Luxury pet garments such as sweaters, pajamas, and indoor shoes are commonly purchased for pets that spend a considerable amount of time inside the home.
